They have different structures. The striated or striped cells of cardiac and skeletal muscles are called muscle fibers.', \"Heart Systole (when the heart squeezes) happens because the muscle cells of the heart gets smaller in size. When they get smaller we also say they contract. Electricity going through the heart makes the cells contract. The electricity starts in the sino-atrial node (acronym SA Node) The SA Node is a group of cells called pacemaker cells in the right atria. These cells start an electrical impulse. This electrical impulse sets the rate and timing at which all cardiac muscle cells contract. This motion is called 'atrial systole'. Once electrical impulse goes through the atrio-ventricular node (AV Node). The AV Node makes the impulse slow down. Slowing down makes the electrical impulses get to the ventricles later. That is what makes the ventricular systole occur after atrial systole, and lets all the blood leave the atria before ventricle contracts (meaning squeeze).\", 'Capillary The capillaries do not have this smooth muscle in their own wall, and so any change in their width is passive.  Any signaling molecules they release (such as endothelin for constriction and nitric oxide for dilation) act on the smooth muscle cells in the walls of nearby, larger vessels, e.g. arterioles.', \"Bradycardia Problems with the heart's electrical system.  There are two atria (upper chambers) in the heart: the right atrium and the left atrium.  For the heart to beat normally, special parts of the right atrium have to send electricity through the heart to make it squeeze out blood.  The electricity has to start in a certain place and pass through a certain route in the heart.  If this does not happen correctly, the heart will not beat correctly.\", 'Cardiomyopathy Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) is the least common cardiomyopathy. The walls of the ventricles are stiff, but may not be thickened, and resist the normal filling of the heart with blood.', 'Cardiac muscle The other types of muscle are the skeletal and smooth muscle.

The myocardium forms a thick middle layer between the outer epicardium layer and the inner endocardium layer.', \"Medulla oblongata Together, these two systems control many important things, like how fast the heart beats and how hard it squeezes.  In the cardiac center, there are special nerves that will make the heart beat harder and faster, called excitatory nerves.  There are also inhibitory nerves, which will make the heart beat slower and not as hard.  If a person's blood pressure gets too low, the cardiac center will send a message to the excitatory nerves, telling them to make the heart beat faster and harder.  This raises the blood pressure.  If the blood pressure gets too high, the cardiac center sends a message to the inhibitory nerves, which slow the heart down and make it not beat so hard.  This lowers the blood pressure.  In a healthy person, the cardiac center balances out the signals it sends to these sets of nerves, to keep the blood pressure normal.\", 'Chr 000000000011000011110001111100010000000011110001110000100100001000000110011001100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000111110000001111110011111101111111', 'Myocardial infarction Sometimes, people have \"silent heart attacks.\" These are heart attacks that do not cause any pain.

The top two are called the atria, and the bottom two are called the ventricles.  When the heart is working normally, electrical signals in the heart tell the to atria squeeze first.
